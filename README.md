# Machine Learning Classification Demo

This repository demonstrates core machine learning workflows using classic datasets from the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

## 📊 Datasets Used
- **Iris**: 3-class flower classification (150 samples, 4 features)
- **Wine**: 3-class wine origin classification (178 samples, 13 features)

## 🧠 Models Implemented
- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (Linear & RBF)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🔍 Key Techniques
- Train/test splitting with stratification
- Feature scaling (`StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`)
- Missing value imputation (for completeness)
- Decision boundary visualization
- Feature importance analysis
- Model benchmarking

## 📈 Visualizations
- Decision regions for 2D projections
- Decision tree plot
- Feature importance bar charts

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neena9940/ml-classification-demo.git
